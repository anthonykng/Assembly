What is your mywc program test plan?

Boundary Tests:
 mywc1.txt   Has no text inside. Tests the lower boundary of the program

Statement Tests:
 mywc1.txt   In the mywc.c file, skips the while loop since first char
             is EOF.
 mywc10.txt  Goes into the while loop since first character isn't EOF.
             Goes into if statment on line 34 because first character
	     is a space. Skips if statement on line 36 because iInWord
	     is FALSE.
 mywc11.txt  Goes into the while loop since first character isn't EOF.
             Skips if statement on line 34 because first character is
	     not a space and goes to else. Goes into if statement on
	     line 44 because iInWord = FALSE.
 mywc12.txt  Files include a newline. Tests if statement on line 48.
             Previous files included no newlines, and they skip this
	     if statement.
 mywc13.txt  File ends outside a word (with a space). Skips if
             statement on line 52.
 mywc14.txt  File ends inside a word. Goes into if statement on line 52
 mywc15.txt  File with multiple lines, words, and characters. Tests if
             statement on line 36.

Stress Tests:
 mywc20.txt  File with random, printable ascii characters. This is a
             more irregular and unusual test case.
 mywc21.txt  File with 50,000 characters. This tests the upper limit of
             the number of characters there are.
 mywc22.txt  File with 1000 lines. This tests the upper limit of the
             number of lines there are.
 mywc23.txt  File with 25,000 words (every other character is a space
             or newline). Tests the upper limit of the number of
	     words there are.
